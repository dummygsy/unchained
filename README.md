# unchained

Unchanined is a repo for syncing the talks & annotations I produced with Notability. Right now it contains these folders:

* blockchain: the whitepaper I annotated. Note I'll gradually add the whitepaper I read into this repo. The annotate I put on whitepapers are pretty personal, it just reflects my questions and preferences.
* talks: The talks I gave since 2018 (I'm starting using Notability to generate my talks)

The most recent talk is "Blockchain Jumpstart". It contains a lot of details on bitcoin, ethereum, etc. and I'll keep update it as I study more and more blockchain related technology.

Please submit issue if you found anything is wrong or you have any comments upon my thoughts.

Thanks and enjoy!
